#' @title
#' Build a Cerebro data set from a Seurat object, by pointing and clicking.
#'
#' @description
#' Opens a local page that reads a Seurat `.rds`, works out what it contains,
#' and lets you choose what the resulting data set should show: which metadata
#' columns are the grouping variables, which dimensional reductions to carry,
#' which assay and layer the expression comes from. It then writes the `.crb`
#' and, if asked, packages it into a standalone Shiny app.
#'
#' It does the same work as calling \code{\link{exportFromSeurat}} yourself. The
#' difference is that it reads the object first and only offers what is actually
#' there -- the layers that exist, the columns that can serve as groups, the
#' reductions that will survive the export -- so the choices that quietly go
#' wrong in a hand-written call are visible before anything is written.
#'
#' @section What this is not:
#' The object is read into this R process, so run it on your own machine or in
#' your own RStudio Server session. It is not meant to be deployed for other
#' people to upload data to: it reads whatever path it is given, and reading an
#' `.rds` runs whatever code is inside it.
#'
#' @param host Address to bind; defaults to \code{127.0.0.1}, i.e. this machine
#'   only.
#' @param port Port to bind; defaults to a free one chosen by Shiny.
#' @param launch_browser Open a browser; defaults to \code{TRUE}.
#' @param max_file_size Maximum size in MB for each local upload; defaults to
#'   8000. The corresponding Shiny process option is restored when the Builder
#'   stops.
#'
#' @return Does not return; runs until the app is stopped.
